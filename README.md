# Haskell Sort Function Unexpected Behavior with List Comprehensions

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior of the `sort` function in Haskell when used with lists generated by list comprehensions, particularly nested lists. The `sort` function fails to sort nested lists correctly, leading to inaccurate results.

## Issue Description
The provided Haskell code showcases that the `sort` function from `Data.List` behaves unexpectedly when applied to nested lists created using list comprehensions. While basic list sorting works correctly, sorting nested lists produced by list comprehensions, especially those involving even and odd numbers, does not result in the expected lexicographically sorted output.  The core issue seems to be related to how Haskell compares lists within lists during the sorting process.

## Resolution
The provided solution clarifies that the `sort` function in `Data.List` sorts lists lexicographically, which means that it works on the first element, then the second, and so on. For nested lists containing lists with different lengths, the result might not be what one intuitively expects.  The solution offers strategies to address this, for example, defining a custom comparison function to achieve the desired ordering.
